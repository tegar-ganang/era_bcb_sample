 * One somewhat unconventional requirement of URLStreamHandler classes 
 * is that the class name and even the package name have certain restrictions. 
 * You must name the handler class Handler, as in the previous example. 
 * The package name must include the protocol name as the last dot-separated token.
 * This way, the Handler is automatically created in a lazy-fashion by the default
 * URLStreamHandlerFactory.
 *
 * see http://java.sun.com/developer/onlineTraining/protocolhandlers/
 * 
 * You should never need to create an instance of this class directly.
