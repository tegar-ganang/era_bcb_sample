/**
 * This class provides a connection between an array of a primitive type,
 * such as byte[], short[], int[], long[],
 * and files on disk storing such arrays in <b>native</b> byte order.
 * It provides methods to write/read an array to/from disk efficiently.
 * 
 * You should create only as many ArrayFiles per thread as need to
 * be open concurrently. The reason is that each ArrayFile allocates
 * a buffer for temporary storage (and thus consumes memory).
 * The buffer size can be passed to the constructor, but not modified
 * subsequently.
 * 
 * To re-use an ArrayFile for a different array or file, just set a new name
 * with the <code>setFilename()</code> method.
