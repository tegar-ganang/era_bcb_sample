/**
 * Threaded stream copying. Was designed to copy from stdout/stderr of processes to
 * main process's stdout/stderr.
 *
 * It will stop on the first IOException or when the stream closes.
 * By default, this will not close the streams it uses, since it is assumed that the out
 * stream is stdout and the in stream is from a process. The former is closed when the whole
 * application is closed and the latter is closed when the process is done/killed.
