/**
 * One of the ways to make sure the user doesn't open more then one process of a program
 * is to use a file as a semaphore. When a process starts it grabs a hold on the file,
 * When the next process starts it will identify that the file is already grabbed
 * and will not start.
 * 
 * This utility class manages file lock mechanism.
 *  
 * To work with the class the process activates the static method {@link #getFileLock(File)}.
 * Once the user has an instance of the class it can try to {@link #grabLock()}, true is returned
 * if the file could be grabbed otherwise false is returned.
 * When the process wants to release the lock it asks for the <code>FileLock</code> instance and 
 * activates the {@link #releaseLock()} method.
