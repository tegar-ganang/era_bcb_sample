/**
 * DbBackup is a helper class for stopping and restarting JE background
 * activity in an open environment in order to simplify backup operations. It
 * also lets the application create a backup which can support restoring the
 * environment to a specific point in time.
 * <p>
 * <b>Backing up without DbBackup:</b>
 * Because JE has an append only log file architecture, it is always possible
 * to do a hot backup without the use of DbBackup by copying all log files
 * (.jdb files) to your archival location. As long as the log files are copied
 * in alphabetical order, (numerical in effect) <i>and</i> all log files are
 * copied, the environment can be successfully backed up without any need to
 * stop database operations or background activity. This means that your
 * backup operation must do a loop to check for the creation of new log files
 * before deciding that the backup is finished. For example:
 * <pre>
 * time    files in                    activity
 *         environment
 *
 *  t0     000000001.jdb     Backup starts copying file 1
 *         000000003.jdb
 *         000000004.jdb
 *
 *  t1     000000001.jdb     JE log cleaner migrates portion of file 3 to newly
 *         000000004.jdb     created file 5 and deletes file 3. Backup finishes
 *         000000005.jdb     file 1, starts copying file 4. Backup MUST include
 *                           file 5 for a consistent backup!
 *
 *  t2     000000001.jdb     Backup finishes copying file 4, starts and
 *         000000004.jdb     finishes file 5, has caught up. Backup ends.
 *         000000005.jdb
 *</pre>
 * <p>
 * In the example above, the backup operation must be sure to copy file 5,
 * which came into existence after the backup had started. If the backup
 * stopped operations at file 4, the backup set would include only file 1 and
 * 4, omitting file 3, which would be an inconsistent set.
 * <p>
 * Also note that log file 5 may not have filled up before it was copied to
 * archival storage. On the next backup, there might be a newer, larger version
 * of file 5, and that newer version should replace the older file 5 in archive
 * storage.
 * <p>
 * <b>Backup up with DbBackup</b>
 * <p>
 * DbBackup helps simplify application backup by defining the set of files that
 * must be copied for each backup operation. If the environment directory has
 * read/write protection, the application must pass DbBackup an open,
 * read/write environment handle.
 * <p>
 * When entering backup mode, JE
 * determines the set of log files needed for a consistent backup, and freezes
 * all changes to those files. The application can copy that defined set of
 * files and finish operation without checking for the ongoing creation of new
 * files. Also, there will be no need to check for a newer version of the last
 * file on the next backup.
 * <p>
 * In the example above, if DbBackup was used at t0, the application would only
 * have to copy files 1, 3 and 4 to back up. On a subsequent backup, the
 * application could start its copying at file 5. There would be no need to
 * check for a newer version of file 4.
 * <p>
 * An example usage:
 * <pre>
 *
 *    Environment env = new Environment(...);
 *    DbBackup backupHelper = new DbBackup(env);
 *
 *    // Find the file number of the last file in the previous backup
 *    // persistently, by either checking the backup archive, or saving
 *    // state in a persistent file.
 *    long lastFileInPrevBackup =  ...
 *
 *    // Start backup, find out what needs to be copied.
 *    backupHelper.startBackup();
 *    try {
 *        String[] filesForBackup =
 *             backupHelper.getLogFilesInBackupSet(lastFileInPrevBackup);
 *
 *        // Copy the files to archival storage.
 *        myApplicationCopyMethod(filesForBackup)

 *        // Update our knowledge of the last file saved in the backup set,
 *        // so we can copy less on the next backup
 *        lastFileInPrevBackup = backupHelper.getLastFileInBackupSet();
 *        myApplicationSaveLastFile(lastFileInPrevBackup);
 *    } finally {
 *        // Remember to exit backup mode, or all log files won't be cleaned
 *        // and disk usage will bloat.
 *       backupHelper.endBackup();
 *   }
 * </pre>
